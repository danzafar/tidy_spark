}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a spark_tbl for training.}

\item{formula}{a symbolic description of the model to be fitted. Currently only a few formula
operators are supported, including '~', ':', '+', and '-'.}

\item{type}{type of model, one of "regression" or "classification", to fit}

\item{maxDepth}{Maximum depth of the tree (>= 0).}

\item{maxBins}{Maximum number of bins used for discretizing continuous features and for choosing
how to split on features at each node. More bins give higher granularity. Must be
>= 2 and >= number of categories in any categorical feature.}

\item{maxIter}{Param for maximum number of iterations (>= 0).}

\item{stepSize}{Param for Step size to be used for each iteration of optimization.}

\item{lossType}{Loss function which GBT tries to minimize.
For classification, must be "logistic". For regression, must be one of
"squared" (L2) and "absolute" (L1), default is "squared".}

\item{seed}{integer seed for random number generation.}

\item{subsamplingRate}{Fraction of the training data used for learning each decision tree, in
range (0, 1].}

\item{minInstancesPerNode}{Minimum number of instances each child must have after split. If a
split causes the left or right child to have fewer than
minInstancesPerNode, the split will be discarded as invalid. Should be
>= 1.}

\item{minInfoGain}{Minimum information gain for a split to be considered at a tree node.}

\item{checkpointInterval}{Param for set checkpoint interval (>= 1) or disable checkpoint (-1).
Note: this setting will be ignored if the checkpoint directory is not
set.}

\item{maxMemoryInMB}{Maximum memory in MB allocated to histogram aggregation.}

\item{cacheNodeIds}{If FALSE, the algorithm will pass trees to executors to match instances with
nodes. If TRUE, the algorithm will cache node IDs for each instance. Caching
can speed up training of deeper trees. Users can set how often should the
cache be checkpointed or disable it by setting checkpointInterval.}

\item{handleInvalid}{How to handle invalid data (unseen labels or NULL values) in features and
label column of string type in classification model.
Supported options: "skip" (filter out rows with invalid data),
                   "error" (throw an error), "keep" (put invalid data in
                   a special additional bucket, at index numLabels). Default
                   is "error".}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to the method.}
}
\value{
\code{ml_gbt} returns a fitted Gradient Boosted Tree model.

\description{
\code{ml_gbt} fits a Gradient Boosted Tree Regression model or Classification model on a
spark_tbl. Users can call \code{summary} to get a summary of the fitted
Gradient Boosted Tree model, \code{predict} to make predictions on new data, and
\code{write_ml}/\code{read_ml} to save/load fitted models.
